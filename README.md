# FAIR Assessment Overview

This assessment evaluates the main FAIR-related concepts addressed in Table 1 of the referenced paper and the conceptual model. The goal is to identify the FAIR components listed in Table 1 and the conceptual model to determine the level of FAIRness of the schema.

We conducted the analysis using the Darwin Core metadata schema as example. However, this analysis was preliminary and superficial. A more detailed assessment should be performed by the authority managing the schema, which in this case is the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG).

## Methodology
The concepts from the conceptual model were associated with one of the Refined FAIR principles presented in Table 1. Each Refined principle was assigned a score of 1. A simple average calculation was then used to determine the percentage of each of the four FAIR principles that were achieved.

Results
The outcome of this assessment is a chart illustrating the level of each of the FAIR principles reached by the schema.
